API Specifications for the Web Service

Types of models ->
    1. Vanilla: Non Trainable, loaded by default on start 
    2. Global: Trainable by any user, loaded by default on start 
    3. Private: Available to user who created it. Trainable by creator, Loaded on request in memory


GET/POST Methods supported as well as Data through JSON and Normal Form data supported.

INPUT FORMAT: JSON/JSON-like/FORMDATA/GET 
OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON 

Stateless Actions ->
    1. Inference: 
        URL: http://<ip>:80/inferAPI/universal
        INPUT Arguments:    text        (text to be classified)
                            apikey      (API Key assigned to/by the user)
                            user        (username/userid through which they log in)
        OUTPUT:     <List type>         {"Negative", "Red", <callid>}
                                        {"Positive", "Green", <callid>}

    2. feedback: Used for training on single wrongly classified samples
        URL: http://<ip>:80/inferAPI/feedback 
        INPUT Arguments:    callid      (callid variable returned while making inference call)
                            apikey      (Api Key assigned to/by the user)
                            user        (username/userid through which they log in)
                            feedback    ('wrong' if wrong, 'correct' if right)
        OUTPUT:     {"Done"} if success

    3. Train on a dataset file:
        URL: http://<ip>:80/inferAPI/train 
        INPUT Arguments:    data        (JSON document with tupples of (text, label) on each line)
        OUTPUT:     {"Done..."} if success 

    4. Save a model to physical memory:
        URL: http://<ip>:80/inferAPI/save 
        INPUT Arguments:        apikey      (API Key assigned to/by the user)
                                user        (username/userid through which they log in)
        OUTPUT:     {"Saved"} if success 
    
    5. Load a model to physical memory:
        URL: http://<ip>:80/inferAPI/load 
        INPUT Arguments:        apikey      (API Key assigned to/by the user)
                                user        (username/userid through which they log in)
        OUTPUT:     {"Saved"} if success 

    6. Create a Model on the physical memory (Uses a template model):
        URL: http://<ip>:80/inferAPI/create 
        INPUT Arguments:        templatekey     (Original Key of which the duplicate is to be made)
                                originaluser    (username of the owner of the templatekey)
                                newkey          (New API Key name, 'none' if want to be generated automatically)
                                newuser         (Username of the new user of the new Key)


        OUTPUT:     {"Created"} if success 

When a user registers successfully, <username>_vanilla and <username>_global API Keys 
are created automatically, linking to vanilla and global models.

Users can share models amongst each other by simply sending appropriate request to 
/inferAPI/create, as state above
